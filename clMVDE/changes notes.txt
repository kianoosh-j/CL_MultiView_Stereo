In 7- propagation, change images are effort of restoring the code to normal. Taking away all of the negative experiments.
change3 is the best one so far without enforce_connectivity, and change4_conne is the best one so far with enforce connectity.

Another good thing which has been done is that in the slic segmentation part, the input arguments to the class constructor
has significnetly decreased.

change5 is the result of removing effect of the color similarity in the init_smoothness(), compute_smoothness(), update().
in order to do so, the similarity has been set to 1. The output improves but at the cost of loosing so much details.

The Edge Computation code has been compeleted. The first test goes with cvt_alternative() and apply_edge_vale(). The result
will be stored in change6_alter1 image.
